Observations:

1.) All of the media outlets have negative compound scores over the last 100 tweets. I believe this is due to the announcements of the deaths of the actor Verne Troyer and the musician Avicii. 

2.) When looking at the scatter plot, CNN sticks out the most for having the most compound scores near zero. However, have the lowest total compound score compared to the other outlets.

3.) Fox looks like it has an almost equal number of positive compound scores and negative compound scores, this is related to it having the compound score closest to zero.
